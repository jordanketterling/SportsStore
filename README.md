# SportsStore
Practice for building a fake Sports Store application. This was used as a practice and a template project for future ASP.NET applications. This goes through the code of creating objects in a store and being able to display a shopping list of selected items with specific traits. This is not to be interpreted as a developmental software product for future deployment.
